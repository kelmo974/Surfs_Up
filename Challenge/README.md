# Ohahu Weather Analysis

## Purpose

The stakeholder to which the results of this analysis will be communicated is a potential key investor in a hybrid surf/ice cream shop located in Hawaii. It is important to compare temperature from day-to-day and across the months throughout the course of the year as weather greatly influences shop traffic and even the desire to eat ice cream. These driving forces will directly impact sales, so before the stakeholder agrees to invest, it is only prudent to gaugue potential revenue. The best way to illustrate this relationship was to perform explroatory data analysis and summarize the temperature findings in tidy graphs plotted against time prior to communicating this information.

## Results
    
    * The difference betweeen average temperatures of June and December is less than 4 degrees. This is realization is a bit surprising for a potential customer that has never been to Hawii before, but ultimately should be an indication of consistent year-round sales. 
    
    * While the difference of average temperatures between June and Decemeber isn't too great, the standard deviation of temperatures is larger in December. This means that there are likely to be more days with sub-optimal conditions as those days could display sizeable variance from the average temperature of 71 F. Being December, it is reasonable to assume that the variance would be moving downward to cooler temperatures, but further analysis would be required to confirm that suspicion.
   
    * The below views of June and December dataframes offer a quick glimpse into some basic metrics of each month's temperature data. 
    The minimum temperature is 10 F higher in June than December. This adds creedence to the previous result regarding variance from the mean likely skewing cooler in December, as opposed to warmer.

## Summary
This inquiry into temperature data of Ohahu has the potential to aid in the projection of an icecream and surf shop's success. It is clear that June offers great temperature conditions for beach goers to surf and eat ice cream. December isn't lagging too far behind - allowing for a gentler downturn in winter months than perhaps would be observed in the continental US. 

However, temperature alone should not be the only parameter considered by investors hoping to see positive ROI from their financial input. Within the scope of weather alone and its impact on revenue, there are multiple parameters that should be included to substantiate any claims of this business's projection. Rainfall, UV index, windspeed, and perhaps realtive humidity could all tip the scales for the viability of this venture. These would be informative queries to pursue.

Outside of this dataset, it would be interesting to investigate tidal trends and wave conditions. Any prospective surfer knows that quality waves can make or break the surfing experience. Furthermore, if the shop intends to sell ice cream, an analysis of the dairy products/consumables, the logistics to bring them to the shop, as well as overhead involved with ice cream storage should all be factored into the decision of whethoer or not to pursue this investment.
